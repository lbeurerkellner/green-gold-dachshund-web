LMQL supports integer and regex constraints, enabling advanced output formatting. The results are automatically represented as the appropriate Python type, and can be manipulated as such.

"A: Today is [RESPONSE: r'[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}']\n"

# generate numbers
"Q: What's the month number?\n"
"A: [ANSWER: int]"

# results are automatically cast to int...
type(ANSWER) # -> int

# ...and can be easily manipulated
