```lmql
# define or import an external function
async def wikipedia(q): ...

# pose a question
"Q: From which countries did the Norse originate?\n"

# invoke 'wikipedia' function during reasoning
"Action: Let's search Wikipedia for the \
 term '[TERM]\n" where STOPS_AT(TERM, "'")

# seamlessly call it *during* generation
result = await wikipedia(TERM)
"Result: {result}\n"

# generate final response using retrieved data
"Final Answer:[ANSWER]"
