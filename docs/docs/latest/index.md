# Latest Documentation Placeholder

During CI builds, this is populated automatically with the `main` state of the documentation, i.e. `/docs/latest` will serve the latest documentation, wheras `/docs/` will always be set to branch `stable-docs`.

For local builds, `/docs/` corresponds to the latest `main` state.
