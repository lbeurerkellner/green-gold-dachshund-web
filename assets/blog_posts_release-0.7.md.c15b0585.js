For this, LMQL implements procedural programming for prompting.

ANSWER <span class="hljs-comment"># May 4th, 2020</span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We first define a simple LMQL function <code>chain_of_thought</code> to do <em>chain-of-thought prompting</em>. In our top-level query, we can then call this function to decode an answer using the <code>[ANSWER: chain_of_thought]</code> syntax. During execution, LMQL then inserts the instructions and constraints from <code>chain_of_thought</code> into the top-level query, generates a value for <code>ANSWER</code>, and then removes the instructions and constraints again, only returning the final result.</p><p><strong>Nested queries are Prompt Function Calls.</strong> This design of nested queries is inspired by the idea of <em>function or procedure calls</em> in traditional programming. Removing intermediate instructions and constraints also has parallels to the idea of <em>stack unwinding</em>, a technique to implement function calls in low-level languages.</p><p>LMQL transfers these ideas to prompting, inheriting the general benefits of procedural programming:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Encapsulation and Model Focus</strong> Nested Queries encapsulate and hide the prompting logic used to generate <code>ANSWER</code>, which means our top-level query is much cleaner and more concise. Further, by hiding intermediate instructions from the model in the context of the top-level query, we can reduce noise in the overall prompt, allowing the model to focus on the currently relevant information only, and not get distracted by previous intermediate steps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nesting and Reuse</strong> LMQL queries can be nested arbitrarily deep, allowing you to reuse and combine queries modularly. For example, you could define a query <code>get_year</code> to extract a year from the response text, and then use this query in <code>chain_of_thought</code> to extract the date from the question. By achieving modularity for sub-prompts, nested queries also allow you to reuse prompts across different query programs.</p></li></ul><p>To learn more about nested queries, please refer to the <a href="./../../docs/language/nestedqueries.html">relevant chapter in the documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="generations-api" tabindex="-1">Generations API <a class="header-anchor" href="#generations-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Generations API&quot;">​</a></h2><p>LMQL 0.7 adds the <em>Generations API</em>, a lightweight high-level library for LMQL-based text generation and scoring.
